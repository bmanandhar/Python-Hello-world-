Learning computer programming using Python

Hi,

I am glad that I have joined the GitHub community and created repository. Let me tell you smething about myself. I am new in the field of CS and learning a programming language, Python. As a matter of fact, I have completed the trainning and now trying to polish the skills I learned. I know I have to work hard in order to master coding. 

I decided to go with Python because I thought it is a language that is widely used. Not to mention, I learned the BASIC and cobol programming anguages long long ago. Somehow, I want to make it clear the the basic knowledge I have by learning those languages help me a lot in learning Python.

I will also look for a job where I can utilise skills I have. I will also stay current in this field so that I will be bale to cope with situation I will have.

Thanks you,
