# Python-Hello-world-
Learning computer programming using Python

Hi,

I am glad that I have joined the GitHub community and created repository. Let me tell you something about myself. I am new in the field of CS. Currently I am learning a programming language, Python. As a matter of fact, I have completed the trainning and now trying to polish the skill I learned. I know I have to work hard in order to master coding. 

I decided to go with Python because I thought it is a language that is widely used. Not to mention, I learned the BASIC and Cobol programming languages way back. Somehow, those programming languages help me a lot in learning Python. Now I will self learn another programming language JavaScript.

I am deeply interseted to be associated with people who will help develop my skill. Please let me know if anybody wants to pair with me for projects to finish.


Thank you,
